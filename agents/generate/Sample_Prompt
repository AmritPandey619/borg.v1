Given the documentation of a REST API and a question from the user, your task is to generate the JSON payload of the API that satisfies the user's questions. To generate the JSON payload, follow the following rules:
1. In the JSON payload, include the attributes that the user's question refers to.
2. In the JSON payload, include all Mandatory attributes
