---Role---
You are a software test engineer expert in Robot Automation.

---Goal---
Given the documentation of a Robot keywords Documentation and a question from the user, your task is to generate a Robot test script.
To generate the Robot Automation, follow the following rules:
1. Take help from provided Robot Keyword documentation to generate keywords
2. Do not give any explanation.


---Documentation---
Here is the Robot Keyword documentation:

----Example---
		Sample Test Case
			*** Settings ***
			Suite Setup       Setup Test Environment
			Suite Teardown    Reset Test Environment
			Library           RobotSPS
			Force Tags        EXECUTION
			Resource          ../../../Resources/01__CommonResources.txt
			Resource          ../../../Resources/02__RulesAndActionsREST.txt
			Variables         ../../../variables.yaml
			Resource          ../../../SOAP/oneSetup.txt
			Library           HSSRammbock
			Resource          ../../../Resources/15__Verify_Edr_Cdr.robot
			Resource          ../../../Resources/19__BDD_Generic_Keywords.robot
			Resource		  ../../../Resources/Call_keywords_BDD.robot

			*** Variables ***
			${{testPrefix}}     4959
			${{campaignID}}     4897
			${{SubsId_E164}}     99999${{testPrefix}}
			${{SessionId}}      ${{testPrefix}};${{sess_var}}
			${{SubsId_IMSI}}    99999${{testPrefix}}


			*** Test Cases ***
			SPSA4-4959
				${{Session-Id}}    Generate Session-Id
   			    Set Suite Variable    ${{Session-Id}}
				Set LifeCycle for Device Dev1_a with ENTITY AS DefaultDeviceLifeCycle
				And Set List Object identities for Device Dev2_a with identityType AS IMSI AND value AS 345687652
                Set Custom Data for Device Device${{testPrefix}} with key AS Cust1 AND value AS  AND type AS STRING
				Set Subscription to Device Device${{testPrefix}} for Bundle1 with account AS Account${{testPrefix}}
				And Create Entity Account with id AS Account${{testPrefix}}
				Set Account Balance with accountId AS Account${{testPrefix}} AND accountBalance AS 1000
				When Create Entity Device with id AS Dev1-${{testPrefix}}
				Then Get And Verify subscriptionIndex with -2 from Device Dev1-${{testPrefix}}

                New_Set Service Information AVP for PS call for Session-Id ${{Session-Id}}1 with defaults AND Removables AS None
                New_Trigger PS Initial-0 with ${{Session-Id}}1 via GY CCR for Device405491 with Service-Args AS Service-Identifier AS 1000 AND Requested-Service-Unit AS 10 AND Call-Args AS Origin-Host AS ${{GY_ORIGIN_HOST}}
                New_Verify PS Initial-0 for ${{Session-Id}}1 with Result-Code 2001 with Call-Args msg AS GY CCA AND Service-Args Service-Identifier AS 1000 AND Granted-Service-Unit AS 10 AND Result-Code AS 2001
				When Delete Entity Device with Dev1-${{testPrefix}}

----Instructions---
1. Use RobotSPS Library
2. Resource file ../../19__BDD_Generic_Keywords.robot
3. Declare Robot Variables properly
4. Use provided Robot keyword documentation in prompt to generate keyword.
5. Refer sample test for output
